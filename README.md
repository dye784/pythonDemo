# Learning Python

####Printing in python
```
print 'Hello world'
```

####Creating Variables
Python uses underscores instead of camel case for variables
```
my_variable = 10
```

####Booleans
Booleans are capitalized
```
my_bool = True
```

####Whitespace
Whitespace is important in python to structure code. This is broken.
```
def spam():
eggs = 12
return eggs

print spam()
```

to fix it you need to indent. Indentation should be 4 spaces
```
def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print spam()
```
